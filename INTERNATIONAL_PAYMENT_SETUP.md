- Currency-specific payment processing

#### UI Improvements

### 3. Backend Changes (index.js)

#### New API Endpoints

##### `/exchange-rates` (GET)
- Fetches live exchange rates from external API
- Returns supported countries with currency information

```javascript
Response Example:
{
  "success": true,
  "rates": {
    "India": { "currency": "INR", "symbol": "₹", "rate": 1 },
    "United States": { "currency": "USD", "symbol": "$", "rate": 0.012 },
    // ... other currencies
  },
  "lastUpdated": "2025-06-20"
}
```

##### `/create-order` (POST) - Enhanced
- Supports multiple currencies
- Proper currency unit conversion (cents for USD, paise for INR)
- Enhanced validation and error handling

```javascript

  "amount": 100,
  "currency": "USD",
  "receipt": "order_12345",
  "notes": { "productName": "Dr. Joints", "customerName": "John Doe" }
}
```

##### `/test-international-payment` (GET)
- Test endpoint to verify international payment functionality
- Tests both exchange rates and order creation
- Useful for debugging and verification

#### Razorpay Configuration
- Updated to handle international currencies
- Proper amount conversion for different currency units
- Enhanced error handling and logging

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables Required
```env
# Razorpay Configuration
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret

# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password

# Other existing variables...
```

### 2. Razorpay Account Setup
1. Enable international payments in your Razorpay dashboard
2. Configure supported currencies
3. Set up webhook endpoints for payment verification
4. Ensure compliance with international payment regulations

### 3. Testing the Implementation

#### Test Exchange Rates API
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/exchange-rates
```

#### Test International Order Creation
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/create-order \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 100,
    "currency": "USD",
    "receipt": "test_receipt",
    "notes": {"test": "international payment"}
  }'
```

#### Test Complete Flow
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/test-international-payment
```

## Currency Support Details

| Country | Currency | Symbol | Razorpay Support |
|---------|----------|---------|------------------|
| India | INR | ₹ | ✅ Full Support |
| United States | USD | $ | ✅ Full Support |
| United Kingdom | GBP | £ | ✅ Full Support |

## Important Notes

### 1. Exchange Rate Updates
- Exchange rates are fetched in real-time when the checkout page loads
- Rates are cached in component state during checkout session
- Backend provides both live and fallback rates

### 2. Payment Processing
- All amounts are converted to the smallest currency unit before sending to Razorpay
- USD: converted to cents (multiply by 100)
- INR: converted to paise (multiply by 100)
- Other currencies: follow similar conversion patterns

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to static exchange rates if API fails
- Comprehensive error messages for payment failures
- Validation for required fields and currency formats

### 4. Security Considerations
- All payment processing happens server-side
- Sensitive Razorpay keys are stored in environment variables
- CORS is properly configured for allowed domains

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Exchange Rate API Failures**
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Verify external API (exchangerate-api.com) is accessible
   - Fallback rates will be used automatically

2. **Razorpay International Payment Errors**
   - Ensure international payments are enabled in Razorpay dashboard
   - Check if selected currency is supported by your Razorpay account
   - Verify webhook configurations

3. **Currency Conversion Issues**
   - Check if amount conversion logic is correct for the specific currency
   - Verify exchange rates are being fetched properly
   - Ensure frontend-backend currency data consistency

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:5000/server-metrics

# Test exchange rates
curl http://localhost:5000/exchange-rates

# Test international payment flow
curl http://localhost:5000/test-international-payment
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Currencies**: Add more currencies based on market demand
2. **Currency Rate Caching**: Implement Redis or database caching for exchange rates
3. **Payment Method Localization**: Show region-specific payment methods
4. **Tax Calculation**: Add international tax calculation based on customer location
5. **Compliance Features**: Add features for international payment compliance
